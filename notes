v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", 1] # set 1 cpu per vm to make sure they don't hang

include_tasks # include was deprecated from ansible since 2023

I had to use import_task instead of include_task in order to make the rolse or tags to work in this new folder structure.

{{ ansible_facts['nodename'] }} fails when you run the playbook with a tag. Facts don't get by default generated as expected.

systemctl show -p ActiveEnterTimestamp nginx
- some sevices will not restart if there is no change in the configuration file

Running a play with --tag proxy will end up in error at nginx config because it can't acces webservers facts. Workaround: run the proxy and web together
