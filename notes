# {{ ansible_facts['nodename'] }} fails when you run the playbook with a tag. Facts don't get by default generated as expected.
# Running a play with --tag proxy will end up in error at nginx config because it can't acces webservers facts. Workaround: run the proxy and web together
# To solve the playbook problem to run only nginx tasks, you need to enforce the facts gathering by addig new task in nginx role
